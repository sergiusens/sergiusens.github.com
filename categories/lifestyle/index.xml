      <description>Triggers Recently, as of last week, I decided to purchase a new laptop to replace my Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with which I was having a bittersweet relationship. The Surface Pro 4 is really nice hardware, I originally got it to get a head start and collaborate on the convergence story with Unity 8 on the desktop, but as is of folk knowledge now, some strategic choices were made.
I still kept the device and actually used it, as I mentioned, it is nice hardware but the support on Linux is just not great, alleviated greatly thanks to jakeday&amp;lsquo;s kernel tree, yet still not fully supported.</description>
