      <description>The release notes for snapcraft 3.0 have been long overdue. For convenience I will reproduce them here too.
Presenting snapcraft 3.0 The arrival of snapcraft 3.0 brings fresh air into how snap development takes place!

      <description>Prologue After a week away from my computer I want to organize my thoughts on the progress made towards build VMs by providing this write up since that forum post can be a bit overwhelming if you are casually wanting to keep up to date.
