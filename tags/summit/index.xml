      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally taking some time to wite about things that happened during UbuCon and SCaLE. I am really grateful for Canonical as without the sponsorship I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been there at all.
UbuCon UbuCon is where was I was mostly involved, I had a scheduled lightning talk, a proper talk that I gave out with Manik and also actively involved in 3 unconference sessions.
Presenting Plenary talk The day started with some an intro to the UbuCon Summit and what it was all about followed by a keynote from Mark Shuttleworth.</description>
